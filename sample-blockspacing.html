    Spent coffee grinds can be reused for hair care or
     skin care as well as in the garden. These can also be used
      as biodiesel fuel. There are four methods of grinding coffee for brewing:
       burr-grinding, chopping, pounding, and roller grinding

    In a pour-over, the water passes through the coffee grounds, gaining soluble compounds to form coffee. Insoluble compounds remain within the coffee filter. Coffee can be brewed in several different ways, but these methods 
    fall into four main groups depending on how the water is introduced to the coffee grounds:

    Brewed coffee, if kept hot, will deteriorate rapidly in flavor, 
    and reheating such coffee tends to give it a "muddy" flavour,
     as some compounds that impart flavor to coffee are destroyed if this is done. 
    Even at room temperature, deterioration will occur; 
    however, if kept in an oxygen-free environment it can last almost indefinitely 
    at room temperature, and sealed containers of brewed coffee are sometimes commercially 
    available in food stores in America or Europe, with refrigerated bottled coffee
    drinks being commonly available at convenience stores and grocery
    stores in the United States. Canned coffee is particularly popular in Japan and South Korea.
